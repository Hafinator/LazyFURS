# LazyFURS

This application will help you convert data from the Etoro report in .xlsx format to EUR that can then be entered on FURSs website.

It can also generate xml reports for Doh-Div, Doh-KDVP and D-IFI which can be directly imported into eDavki.

If you come accross any ISIN which can't be mapped to any Address or Country code, or a Double taxation exemption contract is misssing, you can contact me,
or create a new issue and I will try to resolve it.

# How to help and provide data for faster updates:

For Addresses you can provide them in this formal: 
ISIN, Address 
For Country:
ISIN, ISO_3166-1_alpha-2
