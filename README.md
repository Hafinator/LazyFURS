# LazyFURS

This application will help you convert data from the Etoro report in .xlsx format to EUR that can then be entered on FURSs website.

The current version does **NOT** support direct FURS format, so manual input is still needed.

EDIT: 16.1.2022
After noticing what I would need to do, to make a .xml export that can be consumed by FURS I decided that the hassle is not worth it since you would need to manually add some data anyway.
